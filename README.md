## Summary of the Project
- Used C++ to create a fully-automated, self-sustaining, botanical garden with data-monitoring capabilities, for residential use.
- Developed programming skills by writing a program for managing a properly-running system, including regular data collections, administrating watering three different plants, and more.
- Used Calculus to establish a universal formula that calculates the necessary time for releasing the appropriate amount of water for each plant.
- Developed a deep understanding of Arduino and a practical application of programming throughout the whole project.
